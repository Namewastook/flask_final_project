    {"Customs":
        {"Customs": "Almost certainly the most widespread 'custom' in Antarctica is the Polar Plunge it revolves around being scarily cold, but only briefly. The seas around Antarctica vary from about 28.4F to 35.6F throughout the year, at 28.4F the sea freezes, the salt content makes this happen below 32F, so Antarctic sea water is often as cold as it is possible for water to get, especially in the winter months. Jumping in the sea wearing swimming attire is a surprisingly popular thing to do. Originally something that was done by members of scientific bases particularly at Midwinter or Christmas, this has spread across the continent and now happens far more often as shorter term visitors in the summer want to have a go too."}

When passing through a doorway, it’s customary for men to precede women. Don’t initiate or participate in racist or sexist conversations should the topic arise.

    {"Customs":
        {"Egypt": "Those who want wealth and prosperity to come to their house, bury a weasel at the doorstep. Egyptians believe that burying a weasel at their doorstep will allow them to gain a lot of money and have a better life.",

         "Nigeria": "The most common greeting is a handshake with a warm, welcoming smile. Men may place their left hand on the other person’s shoulder while shaking hands. Smiling and showing sincere pleasure at meeting the person is important. As in the rest of Africa, it is rude to rush the greeting process. You must take the time to ask about the person’s health, the health of their family, or other social niceties. A Nigerian generally waits for the woman to extend her hand. Address people initially by their academic, professional or honorific title and their surname. Always wait until invited before using someone’s first name. When greeting someone who is obviously much older, it is a sign of respect and deference to bow the head.",

         "South Africa": "There are several greeting styles in South Africa depending upon the ethnic heritage of the person you are meeting. When dealing with foreigners, most South Africans shake hands while maintaining eye contact and smiling. Some women do not shake hands and merely nod their head, so it is best to wait for a woman to extend her hand. Men may kiss a woman they know well on the cheek in place of a handshake. Greetings are leisurely and include time for social discussion and exchanging pleasantries."},
